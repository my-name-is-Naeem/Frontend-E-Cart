                                    E-cart-Frontend
                        -------------------------------------

            1.Create a folder E-cart 
            2.inside i it Create a angular Application - ng new e-cart-Frontend
            3.cd e-cart-Frontend
            4.code .
            5.Run angular application - ng s -o
            6.Clear code in app.component.html
            7.Import 3rd party libraries -
                        ->bootstrap(index.html)
                        ->font-awesome(index.html)
                        ->google Fonts(style.css)
            8.Lazy Loading
              -Lazy loading helps keep initial bundle sizes smaller,which in turn helps decrease load times.
               Lazy loading is an approach to limit the modules that
               are loaded to the ones that the user currently needs.
               This can improve your application's performance and reduce the initial bundle size.

            We have one module in our application -app-module
            Here we create another module
            ->Generate module - ng generate module module-name ->ng g m products --route products --module app.module

            9.Component generation
                ->ng g c products/allProducts
                ->ng g c products/viewProducts
                ->ng g c products/wishlist
                ->ng g c products/cart
              Not in lazy Loading
                ->ng g c header
                ->ng g c footer
                ->ng g c pageNotFound 

            10.Setup Path
            ->put <router-outlet></router-outlet> in app.component.html
            ->products.routing.module.ts -> 

            11. API Integration

                =>import HttpClientModule in app.module.ts
                =>Create a services inside product module - for API Calling
                   -ng g s products/services/api
                =>Inside api.services.ts file 
                    -create and use http dependency injection
                    -also create a function for (getAllProducts()) fetching all products details.
                =>Inside all-Products.component file ,
                    -Create and use api dependency injection
                    -also create a function in api.services.ts for integrating api service
                    -get all products details

                =>Wishlist functionality is Completed

                =>Product Search
                    -ng g p products/pipes/filter
